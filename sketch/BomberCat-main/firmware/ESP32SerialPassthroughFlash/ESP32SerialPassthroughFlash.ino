   ESP32SerialPassthroughFlash v1.0
   ESP32 / NINA Serial Passthrough for flashing using Arduino MCU
   This Arduino sketch allows you to send AT commands, watch bootloader messages, or flash an ESP32 through a RP2040 or similar MCU. 
   The MCU should be operating at 3.3V, if not, voltage level shifters must be used on the connections to ESP.
   The program might also work on other ESPs, but have only been tested with ESP32.
   
   Developed and tested with a Arduino RP2040-based.
   The program might work on MCUs without native USB, but no guarantees! :-)
   Sending AT commands has been tested using the Arduino serial monitor, Visual Micro serial monitor and Putty in serial mode.
   The same goes for watching bootloader output.
   Firmware upgrade/flashing has been done with the official ESP32 Flash Download Tool from https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools, 
   with firmware downloaded from https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/at
